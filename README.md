# food-101_updated

This project based on the Food101 Paper which used Convolutional Neuranetwork trained for 2 to 3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy. The project is made by download the food101 dataset from the TensorFlow dataset(size: 4.6GB) which consists of 750 images x 101 training classes = 75750 training images. I used the EfficientNetB0 model with fine-tune unfreeze all layers of the model.
